                <h2>About Suki's car üèé</h2>
                <p>The S2000 was released in 1999 to celebrate Honda's 50th anniversary, the Roadster has a striking design that despite being a 90s release still contains current traits. 
                    What most excites about the Honda is its engine, which, as the brand's characteristics, is very spinning, in this specific model the rotation limit is practically that of a motorcycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suki's S2000 has a custom set of pink vinyls and a bottle of Nitrous behind the seats. Its engine is a 2-liter aluminum-alloy DOHC F20C1 inline 4 with a Comptech supercharger. It also features a Paxton Novi 1000 Toucan Industries exhaust with a non-functioning Ractive chrome tip. Appearance mods include a VeilSide Millennium body kit, Motegi Racing 18" rims, and airbrushed artwork done by Noah of Noah Fine Art.

                <p>Suki is considered one of the best female pilots in the film series.</p>
                <p>+ Fast + Furious may be approaching two decades since release, but Suki deserves a place in the franchise. It would also be a treat for longtime fans to know what the character has been up to since her racing days in her pink Honda.</p>
